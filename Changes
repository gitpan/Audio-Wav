  - fixed a bug in Audio::Wav::Read::move_to, now adds where the data actually starts to the position given.
  - Audio::Wav::Read::move_to now rereads data length to see if file has grown since this was last read.
  - added method Audio::Wav::Read::reread_length, rereads the length of the file in case it is being written to as we are reading it.
  - added method Audio::Wav::Read::read_raw_samples which will read X samples in raw format.
  - added method Audio::Wav::Read::position_samples which returns the current audio data position in samples.
  - in method Audio::Wav::Write::add_cue, if sample position supplied is undefined, then the position will be the current position (end of all data written so far).
  - in method Audio::Wav::Write, moved the option of not caching data from the write_raw method to new.

  - Fixed a circular reference in Audio::Wav::Write::Header that was causing memory to leak (thanks Sumitro Chowdhury).

  - When writing files, finish() will now be called by DESTROY if necessary.
